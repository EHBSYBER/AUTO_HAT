Hey , plz paste the above Code below onCreate..

After that you need to add Font for Your Title and Icon  in Assets folder named as "Modder_Hub_Tiltle" and "Modder_Hub_Icon" respectively..
Plz don't try to change this name to any other name.. otherwise your app will crash after adding changing the font name. Remember This⚠️⚠️

Don't forgot to add This assets on your app..Okay
